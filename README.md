# About Me:
Hi! I am a software engineer that started because I wanted to automate something.
It has been a passion ever since, but it got extremely more fun starting the 19/02/2024 once I discovered what I can do.
I can't tell you about the project, and can also not showcase it on youtube as it can come at a cost of me getting banned on platforms I use a ton, Especially YouTube haha :)

Other than that I am focusing on these technologies currently, as I see the longevity & ease of use in them:
- Dart & Flutter
- Python
- Golang
- Firebase & Supabase


# Quotes
Now lets get on to some quotes shall we?
These quotes makes me think of a better world.

_"Look at everything that exists, and observe that it is already in dissolution and in change, called purification. Nothing is made to stay constant, but erratic despirsion destroys a craft."_ - Anonymous

_"Focus on being productive instead of busy."_ - Tim Ferriss

_"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."_ â€” Will Durant

_"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. So focusing on many things makes you good at being mediocre at all, but focusing on one 
 leads you to master many!"_ - AdonisCodes, Extension of Will Durant

# Thanks!
Thanks for reading this far.
If you fancy you could always take a peek at what I have been up to.
Mostly I will be working on projects which improves on one of the technologies above.
