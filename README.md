There is one truth in this world usually, and am not talking about a spiritual one, we as humans believe what we can see (mostly). And I have figured that numbers do matter, as they show an actual progression to something. This made me decide that working on github-contributions, and other similar metrics, I would effectively be able to determine the trajectory of anything I am working on. It also somehow brings a piece of mind when I tell myself `Just 5 commits today, which will equate to about 100 - 400 lines of code`. Maybe it is just me, but that makes my mind calm down.
